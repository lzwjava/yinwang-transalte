Preventing and reversing myopia is a relatively simple matter, understanding the underlying principles only requires high school optics knowledge, and the specific operation method only requires an additional pair of glasses, yet I only discovered this recently.</p>
<h3 id="简短版"> 

Short version</h3>
<p> This article has become a bit lengthy due to the addition of many principle explanations. If you're not patient enough to read those principles, there's a two-sentence version here. To reverse myopia, you only need to do one thing:</p>
<ol>
<li> 

Wear a pair of glasses that are 100 degrees less than your original degree. Wearing these glasses will give you a visual effect similar to that of a person with 100 degrees of myopia, which will not significantly affect your daily life. From then on, you can wear these glasses and live normally, using your eyes as you normally would, without needing to do anything special.</li>
<li> 

After several months, you will find that your vision has improved, and your prescription has decreased. When your prescription has decreased by around 50 degrees, go get a new pair of glasses with a prescription that is 100 degrees lower than your actual one. Repeat this process until your vision is restored to 1.0.</li>
</ol>
<p> 

Those who are impatient can go ahead and operate, but if you don't believe it's that simple and want to understand the principle behind this method, then keep reading.</p>
<h3 id="眼球外部肌肉的秘密"> The secret of the extraocular muscles.</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.yinwang.org/images/eye-muscles.jpg" width="50%"/></p>
<p> The causes of myopia can be traced back to the external muscles of the eyeball. There are six precise muscles on the outside of the eyeball (four rectus muscles and two oblique muscles). Many people think that these external muscles are only used to rotate the eyeball, but 100 years ago, an ophthalmologist named W. H. Bates discovered through experiments on animal eyes that these muscles can also change the shape of the eyeball and perform precise focusing operations.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.yinwang.org/images/eye-muscles2.jpg" width="64%"/></p>
<p> 

The diagram shows that the two oblique muscles surround the sides of the eyeball, which can jointly produce lateral pressure, making the eyeball longer by squeezing. Meanwhile, the four straight muscles work together to pull backward, making the eyeball shorter. Bates' experiment (by electrifying these muscles) also demonstrated the above phenomenon. Under the interaction of these 6 muscles, the eyeball is constantly changing shape.</p>
<p> 

It is commonly believed that the human eye only focuses by changing the shape of the crystalline lens through the ciliary muscle, but in fact, the external muscles of the eyeball also participate in this operation, changing the shape of the eyeball (changing the length of the optical axis) to focus. You can think of the eyeball as a camera with a movable base plate, which can focus by changing the focal length of the lens (crystalline lens) and also by simultaneously changing the position of the base plate (retina) to focus.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.yinwang.org/images/eye-camera.jpg" width="60%"/></p>
<p> 

Compared to the focusing range of the crystalline lens, the changes that can be achieved by changing the shape of the eyeball are relatively small. It can be thought that the crystalline lens is responsible for "coarse focusing", while the external muscles that change the shape of the eyeball are responsible for "precise focusing". Because the external muscles can change the shape of the eyeball, they play a crucial role in the formation and reversal of myopia.</p>
<h3 id="近视产生的原理"> The principle of myopia formation.</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.yinwang.org/images/behind-retina.jpg" width="40%"/></p>
<p> 

When looking closely, if the eyeball is completely relaxed, the image will fall behind the retina. To see objects clearly, the crystalline lens needs to be compressed, increasing the refractive power. At the same time, the shape of the eyeball may also be slightly elongated by the external muscles, allowing the image to fall exactly on the retina. If you look closely for too long, the eyeball may remain in an elongated state. If this shape is maintained for a long time, the axis of the eye will lengthen, making it difficult to see distant objects clearly when looking far away, leading to myopia.</p>
<p> 

Therefore, the fundamental cause of myopia is prolonged tension when looking at close-range objects (such as books, mobile phones, and computers), and has no direct relation to light or genetics. Prolonged close-range viewing causes the eye axis to lengthen, making it easier for the ciliary muscle to focus on close objects, so myopia is a feature of animal eyes, not a bug. The lengthening of the eye axis is an adaptation to make it easier for people to look at close objects, so who can blame you for looking at so many things up close?</p>
<p> Many people think that children's myopia is "false myopia", thinking it's caused by ciliary muscle tension, and that the eyeball hasn't deformed, so they seek help from various methods that claim to treat "false myopia". In fact, children's myopia is also caused by the elongation of the eye axis, which is true myopia, so all the methods that claim to treat "false myopia" are ineffective. I think the term "false myopia" is just a preparation for various ineffective products that take advantage of people's ignorance, and can be said to be a pseudoscientific term.</p>
<h3 id="不近视的基因"> 

The "gene" of not being nearsighted.</h3>
<p> 

Some people claim to have "good genes" and think that no matter how they abuse their eyes, they won't become nearsighted. However, I've found that these people seem to have a special way of using their eyes. Although they appear to be constantly looking at close objects, their eyes are actually in a relaxed state, not focusing on the nearby area, but rather on a point behind the screen or a very small spot on the screen. In this case, the crystalline lens is relaxed, and the eyeball is not stretched, so even though they "look close" for a long time, they won't become nearsighted because they're not truly focusing on the nearby area. This way of using the eyes is introduced in Bates' book and is called "Central Fixation".</p>
<p> 

Therefore, I think that the so-called "non-myopic gene" may not be a physiological inheritance, but rather a psychological and habitual "inheritance". Parents' education and lifestyle are passed down to their children, so they develop good habits of looking at things, and as a result, they won't be near-sighted. On the other hand, in families that value academics, parents read a lot of books, and their children also follow suit and love to read, resulting in myopia, and then people think it's inherited.</p>
<h3 id="近视度数与清晰范围的关系"> The relationship between nearsightedness and "clear vision range".</h3>
<p> 

If you have myopia and don't wear glasses, it's very difficult for your degree to exceed 300 degrees, and it usually stops around 200 degrees. This is because when the eyes of a 200-degree myopic person are completely relaxed, they can clearly see objects 0.5 meters away. This 0.5-meter distance is called the "clear range" of 200-degree myopia, and people with 200-degree myopia can see objects clearly within this distance. Why do I know it's 0.5 meters? The formula is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p> 

Exercise: Based on this formula, how far away can an object be seen clearly by a person with 300 degrees of nearsightedness?</p>
<p> 

According to this formula, you can also estimate how close you need to look at an object to produce a certain degree of myopia. For example, if your eyes need to produce 200 degrees of myopia, you can clearly see an object 0.5m away when the crystalline lens is completely relaxed. Therefore, continuously looking at objects 0.5m (or further) away can cause myopia that will not exceed 200 degrees.</p>
<p> 

Objects within 0.5m of view basically require bending and twisting, and one will also feel uncomfortable and adjust accordingly. Therefore, if someone doesn't wear glasses, it's relatively difficult to exceed 300 degrees of nearsightedness.</p>
<h3 id="如何防止近视发展"> How to prevent myopia from progressing</h3>
<p> 

The causes of high myopia are generally due to wearing full-prescription (or over-corrected) glasses when looking at close objects. Myopic eyes are originally more relaxed when looking at close objects, and the ciliary muscle does not need to exert much force. Therefore, if you don't wear glasses when looking at close objects, myopia will not develop severely. However, after wearing full-prescription glasses, this feature that makes looking at close objects relaxed is cancelled out, and the ciliary muscle still needs to exert force to obtain the required refractive power. The external muscles continue to lengthen the eye axis, resulting in the eye axis continuing to lengthen, and myopia continues to deepen. Then, you go for another eye exam, get a new prescription, and it becomes a vicious cycle...</p>
<p> 

So for people who are already nearsighted, it's best not to match their glasses to a 1.0 diopter prescription, and their daily glasses should be at least 25 degrees less than the 1.0 diopter basis.</p>
<p> 

If you already have myopia and your prescription is not over 200 degrees, then be careful when looking at close objects and avoid wearing glasses, as wearing full-prescription glasses to look at close objects is the root cause of myopia deepening. You can wear glasses when looking at distant objects. Additionally, be mindful of the reading distance and avoid it being too close, so that myopia will not develop further.</p>
<p> 

Why do ophthalmologists and opticians all tell you to get a full prescription, otherwise it will worsen myopia? Because the higher your myopia degree, the better their business is.</p>
<h3 id="近视逆转的原理"></h3>
<p><img src="https://www.yinwang.org/images/infront-retina.jpg" width="40%"/></p>
<p> The natural reversal of myopia, the key lies in "looking far". Note that the "looking far" here is in quotes.</p>
<p> 

Here is the English translation:

First, let me explain what "looking far" means. The "far" referred to here is not a fixed distance, but rather the position of the object's image in the eyeball. If the crystalline lens is completely relaxed and the image still falls in front of the retina (as shown in the figure above), then it is considered "looking far" for human vision. Therefore, for someone with 1.0 vision, it's considered "looking far" if they can see an object 6 meters away, while for someone with 100 degrees of myopia, it's considered "looking far" if they can see an object 1 meter away (100/100 = 1), and for someone with 500 degrees of myopia, it's considered "looking far" if they can see an object 0.2 meters away (100/500 = 0.2).</p>
<p> When looking far away, the crystalline lens needs to relax, reducing its refractive power. If the crystalline lens is completely relaxed and the image still falls in front of the retina, the object will not be clear. At this time, if you continue to gaze at the object, the external muscles of the eyeball will start to compress the eyeball gently, shortening the optical axis by a small amount (maybe only 0.x mm), making the blurry object gradually clearer. If you are often in this blurry state, the optical axis will repeatedly compress slightly, and it will eventually become permanently shortened, and myopia will be reversed.</p>
<p> 

The key to reversing myopia lies in frequently being in a state where distant objects appear slightly blurry. The objects don't have to be very far away, as long as they exceed the clear vision range. For example, if you already have 200 degrees of myopia, you can achieve the effect of reversing myopia by looking at objects more than 0.5 meters away without wearing glasses.</p>
<p> 

Note that this requires long-term habitual operation, best done unknowingly and naturally, becoming a habit. Intentionally setting aside time every day to "practice" often fails to achieve good results. Additionally, pay attention to looking at objects naturally, without forgetting to blink or staring for too long, which is bad for the eyes. Gently look at distant objects, and your eyes will naturally adjust.</p>
<h3 id="逆转近视的具体方法"> 

Specific methods to reverse myopia.</h3>
<p> 

Now that we understand the principle, let's take a look at how to operate it in detail.</p>
<p> The simplest and most brutal way to reverse nearsightedness is to completely stop wearing glasses. Recently, an 18-year-old young man, who originally had over 600 degrees of nearsightedness in both eyes, listened to my explanation of the principle and began to stop wearing glasses in daily life (except when he had to see distant objects clearly), and as a result, his degree of nearsightedness decreased by around 100 degrees after three months.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.yinwang.org/images/nora-chat1.jpg" width="36%"/></p>
<p><img src="https://www.yinwang.org/images/nora-chat2.jpg" width="36%"/></p>
<p> 

For people with high myopia, not wearing glasses at all can be quite painful, so I recommend a more gradual approach, which is to wear "low-degree glasses." The method is as follows: if you have 600 degrees of myopia, reduce the degree of your glasses by 100 degrees and get a pair of 500-degree glasses, without reducing the astigmatism. After wearing them, the scenery you see will be equivalent to that of someone with only 100 degrees of myopia, and your daily life will be almost unaffected.</p>
<p> 

The clear vision range of 100-degree myopia is 1 meter, so as long as you look at objects more than 1 meter away, you can achieve the effect of reversing myopia. This glasses' effect is to reduce the distance calculated as "looking far", turning many places that were originally "looking near" with full-degree glasses into "looking far", thus greatly increasing the opportunities for looking far.</p>
<p> 

So the method is to wear a pair of glasses with a 100-degree reduction, and just wear them all the time. After a few months, the degree of myopia should decrease somewhat. If you clearly feel that things are clearer than before, it's estimated that when it has decreased by 50 degrees, go for an eye exam, get a pair of glasses with a lower degree, and maintain a difference of 100 degrees from the actual degree. This is a virtuous cycle...</p>
<p> 

However, wearing 100-degree glasses to look at the computer may be a bit too clear, so if you want to see the effect faster, you can wear another pair of 150-degree glasses. Normally, wear 100-degree glasses outside, and when looking at the computer, switch to 150-degree glasses and place the screen at a slightly blurry distance of 0.66m or more (100/150 = 0.66m). The more you look at the computer, the better your vision will become. But I don't recommend straining to see every word clearly, just let it be blurry, and don't get too tired, remember to rest.</p>
<p> 

Additionally, it is necessary to note that the font size on the screen should not be set too large. Many people mistakenly believe that large font sizes can protect their eyesight, but in fact, it is the opposite. A large font size has a wide viewing angle, equivalent to looking at an object that is closer. Setting the screen font to a normal size or slightly smaller will reduce the viewing angle, equivalent to looking at an object that is farther away. Over time, eyesight will improve.</p>
<p> 

Because the brain always chooses the image provided by the better eye, this method always makes the better eye even better, so if the vision of the two eyes differs too much, it will become even more unbalanced. If the difference in vision between the two eyes is greater than 50 degrees, glasses need to be worn to make the vision of the two eyes more even.</p>
<p> 

This method will be very slow, so don't be impatient. Think about how many years your myopia has developed, so reversing it won't be quick either. Being able to reverse 25 degrees in 3 months is already very good, and that means you'll have 100 fewer degrees in a year. Because the muscles are quietly exerting force on the eyeball, you need to be careful not to overexert yourself when looking, and not to overdo it. This is similar to the principle of not overdoing exercise. People over 40 years old need to be especially careful, as the vitreous body of the eyeball starts to age, and if you overexert yourself when looking, you may develop floaters. If you're too aggressive and your vision improves significantly in a very short time, you should be on high alert and be careful not to damage your eyes!</p>
<p> 

I'm not convinced that this method is suitable for everyone. Although I think the eyes shouldn't be fixed at a certain age like people commonly believe, the eyeballs may indeed have an age close to being "fixed". If you've exceeded that age, it may not be easy to reverse, or it may be very slow. If you've tried for a year and haven't seen any changes, it's possible that your eyes have already become fixed.</p>
<h3 id="近视度数很高的情况"> 

In cases where the degree of nearsightedness is very high.</h3>
<p> 

Because high myopia can easily lead to serious problems such as retinal detachment, if the degree exceeds 800, it is best to go to the hospital for a fundus examination first. If there are no problems, then carefully try with a small dose, and never use too much force when looking at things.</p>
<h3 id="近视度数很低的情况"> In cases where the degree of myopia is very low.</h3>
<p> If you have reduced your myopia to 100 degrees or less through the above methods, or if your myopia was originally relatively low, such as below 100 degrees, then it is relatively difficult to recover to 1.0 vision without wearing glasses. This is because when the degree is too low, the external muscle produces a small change in the shape of the eyeball, making it difficult to form a sustained change.</p>
<p> For cases with very low myopia, you can use the method of wearing presbyopic glasses. For example, if you have 100 degrees of myopia, you can buy a 50-degree presbyopic glasses. After wearing it, it will become a visual effect of 150 degrees of myopia, so you will start to see objects outside 0.66m blurry. If you wear this presbyopic glasses to look at the screen every day, your myopia will decrease. Once it decreases to a certain level, you can buy another 100-degree or 150-degree presbyopic glasses to wear, until your vision is restored to 1.0 or even better.</p>
<h3 id="方便的视力评估方法"> 

Convenient visual acuity assessment method</h3>
<p> 

If you've been trying it out for a while, how can you conveniently know if there's been any improvement? It's not possible to go for an eye exam every three days, and it's too troublesome to hang a vision chart at home. I have a simple method, which is to choose a reference object in a place where you often sit, preferably with writing on it. For example, I like to sit on the sofa and look at the logo of the Marshall speaker on the TV cabinet, and based on its clarity, I know if my vision has improved or not.</p>
<p> 

If you want to be more precise, you can take a piece of paper with writing on it and a steel ruler, and use the ruler to measure the distance that each eye can see clearly. Then, based on the formula "nearsightedness degree = 100/clear distance", you can get an approximate degree. Alternatively, you can simply remember the distance you can see clearly and use it as a basis for comparison.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 id="自然很重要"> 

Nature is very important.</h3>
<p> 

Compared to my completely "effortless" natural vision restoration method, there are many other methods circulating online, such as EndMyopia. These methods typically require you to do specific things, like spending a lot of time on "Active Focus" exercises. Some methods ask you to stare at a distance with great effort, even to the point of not blinking and continuing to look despite tears and pain. Some use "3D stereo images" for "cross-eye" exercises, and greatly exaggerate the speed of improvement.</p>
<p> 

These methods make people think that they must do something, must strictly follow their instructions, and only then will they be effective, but they haven't figured out the principle of reversing myopia. I also tried some of these exercises for a short time, but later I found out that they were not using my eyes naturally and might cause serious tension, even leading to eye injuries. Later, I discovered that actually, no special exercises are needed, and simply adjusting the prescription of my glasses to a lower degree is enough.</p>
<p> 

This type of exercise appears to be "natural", but it may actually be quite dangerous. The eyes are living organs with blood and flesh, and they have elasticity, not like dough that can be molded into shape at will. They cannot permanently change their shape in a short period of time, and they may get injured. Pain is a very important signal that tells you to stop harming yourself. If you ignore the signal of pain, you may get hurt. Therefore, I do not recommend any method that may cause eye discomfort, and I do not believe anyone who advocates "endure the pain and persevere, persistence is victory". You should know that this world is full of scammers who may want to harm people.</p>
<p>Although my method, apart from wearing glasses, does not have any special training, it has maximized the approach to "natural vision", but it is still possible to experience abnormal fatigue or pain due to the glasses being too low in power, or looking for too long, or having a certain "ambition". Therefore, I suggest that once pain or abnormal tension appears, stop the current method immediately and take a full rest. If you still feel uncomfortable after multiple attempts, you can slightly increase the power of your glasses, such as reducing it by 75 degrees or 50 degrees, and wait until the discomfort disappears and your vision returns to normal before continuing to try.</p>
<p> 

Although you know you should be "natural", this matter ultimately has some purposefulness in it, so some people may unconsciously overuse their eyes or force themselves to do certain things. I've summarized some signals that can remind yourself when you're doing something you shouldn't be doing.</p>
<ul>
<li> 

Pain or soreness in the orbital region, temple, or eyeball.</li>
<li> 

Vision has become blurry, and things that were previously clear to see are now unclear.</li>
<li> 

The object has a double shadow.</li>
<li> 

The focusing speed of the eyes slows down.</li>
<li> 

Flies are appearing.</li>
</ul>
<p> 

If you encounter the above situations, you should stop and rest. If the above phenomena occur frequently, you should check your behavior. For example, do you often force your eyes to see distant or blurry objects clearly? Do you stare at one spot for too long? Do you forget to blink? Do you always focus on seeing far away without looking at things nearby? And so on.</p>
